# workshop-caurosel
Objective
=========
Make a working carousel demo, like this one :
https://spencerkekauoha.github.io/lesson-carousel/

Like the example we will be using slick.
http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
I'm confident that there are other resources that we could use to accomplish the same thing. For now, we'll practice

We will need images to use in our carousel. I really like this resource:
https://unsplash.com/

step one
========
Fork and clone this repo.

step two
========
Familiarize yourself with the code. Get familiar particularly the index.html. You don't need to worry about the css for now. Open index.html in your browser or use live-server. See where the current picture of a horse is? That is where we are going to setup our carousel.

step three
